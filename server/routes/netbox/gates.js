/**
 * Who may use which /api/nb route.
 *
 * The mount authenticates (auth.requireAuth puts req.user on the request);
 * each route then says, on the route itself, which roles it is for. The list
 * is short and deliberate, from the frozen drift workflow
 * (docs/design/drift-approval-workflow.md):
 *
 *   technician  owner, org_admin, site_manager and member. A member is the
 *               person at the rack: they adopt a scan, compare it to NetBox,
 *               read their own plan and hand it to the admin. Nothing else.
 *   admin       owner, org_admin and site_manager. They assign, decide,
 *               read every plan and ticket in their organisation, and write.
 *
 * The Approvals sub-application (/api/approvals) is gated from the same list,
 * with the three roles the manager's specification adds:
 *
 *   approver    owner, org_admin and approver. Approve, reject and rework,
 *               and nothing else on a plan.
 *   auditor     owner, org_admin and auditor. Reads everything, writes
 *               nothing, not even a comment.
 *   readers     everyone who may open the sub-application at all. What each
 *               of them actually SEES is decided in lib/approvals/service.js,
 *               which scopes every list to the caller's organisation and, for
 *               a technician or a site manager, to their own Site. The gate is
 *               here so a role nobody planned for is refused at the door.
 *   writer      owner and org_admin: the two roles that write to NetBox.
 *
 * A route with no gate is a route a member can reach, so every route under
 * scans, plans and netbox carries one. The tests in test/netbox/rules.test.js
 * check the member's six routes answer and the rest refuse.
