 * and was never written, or whose write NetBox refused part of. It does no
 * writing of its own. After the checks a request needs - a NetBox, an

 * the check's SPOC did not approve, and everything that does is in the change
 * registry. A check nobody approved answers 409 with the write's own sentence.
 *
 * Body: { planId }. Without one this refuses, because a push nobody signed is
 * the thing the whole workflow exists to prevent.
 *
 * When NetBox has moved since the approval, nothing is written and the check
 * goes back to be approved again. A check from before checks went to a SPOC
 * has nobody to re-compare it, so, as this door always did, the comparison as
 * it stands now is filed as a new plan to review (`newPlanId`).
