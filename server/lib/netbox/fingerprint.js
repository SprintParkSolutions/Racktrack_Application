/**
 * The port fingerprint: rung 6 of the device ladder.
 *
 * A 48 port switch with cables in 31 of its sockets is wearing a 48 digit
 * number on its face. The live switch reports the same number as which of its
 * ports are up. Neither side needs a label, a serial or a model to be read:
 * the camera sees the cables, the switch reports the links, and the two
 * numbers are compared digit by digit.
 *
 * This is the rung that separates two identical unlabelled switches one shelf
 * apart, which is the case no other rung can settle and the case our own
 * office rack is full of. Two switches of the same model and firmware rarely
 * carry the same pattern, and when they do, the uplinks differ.
 *
 * The rules, from the plan (docs/netbox/match-and-reconcile-detailed.html,
 * "Cables and ports: the fingerprint"):
 *
 *   cabled  and up    agree
 *   empty   and down  agree
 *   cabled  and down  UNKNOWN, never a mismatch. A dark spare, a dead far end
 *                     and a port somebody shut down all look like this.
 *   empty   and up    a camera miss, or a port on the rear. Reported, and it
 *                     counts against the candidate, lightly.
 *   socket not visible (a bundle across the front) drops out entirely. It is
 *                     never read as empty.
 *
 * The uplinks are the sharpest digits: four cages, each populated or not, and
 * two switches rarely share all four. They are weighted accordingly.
 *
 * Nothing here decides anything on its own. It scores one candidate against
 * one box and says how sure it is; rank() orders the candidates and refuses
 * when the winner does not clearly beat the runner up. A tie is never broken
 * by picking the first one.
