/**
 * Change plans - now an adapter, not a store.
 *
 * A comparison against NetBox produces a diff, and this module makes that diff
 * a durable object with an id, so that an approval is a signature on THAT list
 * rather than on "whatever the differences are right now", a ticket hangs off
 * one item of it, the push writes only what was approved, and the history is
 * the sequence of plans over time.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED ON 18 SEPTEMBER 2026. The plan used to be a JSON file per plan
 * with an index beside it, and every rule about a plan lived in this file. The
 * manager's ticketing and approval specification needs twenty-two statuses,
 * SLA clocks, notifications and reports across plans, which is a database
 * question and not a directory of files. So the plans moved into SQLite tables
 * in auth.db and the rules moved with them:
 *
 *   lib/approvals/store.js    the tables and plain reads and writes
 *   lib/approvals/machine.js  which status follows which, and who may move it
 *   lib/approvals/shape.js    the fingerprint, one row of a plan, the counts,
 *                             and the OLD SHAPE this file still hands back
 *   lib/approvals/service.js  the operations, with the rules applied
 *
 * WHAT DID NOT CHANGE is this file's face. Every function keeps its name, its
 * arguments and the exact object it returned, because the phone app, the
 * /api/nb routes and the tests that pin the frozen workflow all read it:
 * `plan.items[].ticket` nested on the item, the four old status words, the old
 * event lines. shape.legacyPlan() builds that view from the tables on each
 * read. Nothing here writes a file, and nothing here reads one.
 *
 * WHO IS ASKING. These functions take a name and nothing else - `{ by: 'meera' }` -
 * from callers that had already decided the caller was allowed: a unit test, a
 * script, a route that gated itself first. They arrive at the service as a
 * `trusted` actor, so the item rules still hold in full (assign before decide,
 * a port follows its device, a rebind is never sent to the rack) while the
 * status table and the role checks stand aside. A route that wants the rules
 * in full calls the service directly, which is what /api/approvals does.
