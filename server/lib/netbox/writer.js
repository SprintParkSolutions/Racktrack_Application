/**
 * The NetBox writer.
 *
 * Four rules decide whether this is deployable. They are implemented here, not
 * described elsewhere and hoped for:
 *
 *   1. IDEMPOTENT.  NetBox has no upsert. Every object carries our uid in the
 *      racktrack_uid custom field; we GET by it, then POST or PATCH. Push the
 *      same scan twice and NetBox holds one clean set of records. A scan
 *      later keyed on the customer's rack finds the records it wrote under
 *      its photo hash and REBINDS them (the uid field alone, and only once
 *      the admin has seen and approved it) rather than writing a second set.
 *   2. DRY-RUN FIRST.  plan() performs no writes and returns the exact diff
 *      push() would apply.
 *   3. NEVER DELETE.  There is no delete path in this module or in the client
 *      it uses. A device that has vanished from a scan is REPORTED for a human
 *      to judge; it is never removed, and not even set offline unless asked.
 *      A tool that removes production records loses all trust the first time
 *      it is wrong, and it will eventually be wrong.
 *   4. CONFIDENCE -> STATUS.  Proven becomes `connected`, camera-only becomes
 *      `planned`, and a CONFLICT is not exported at all — a disagreement is a
 *      finding for review, not a fact to write down.

 * of a device somebody created by hand, carries none of our uids, so every one
 * of those is planned as a create and refused by NetBox on its own uniqueness
 * rules. Eight such refusals turned one live write into "write_failed" for
 * objects that were already correct.
 *
 * So: look the object up by the natural key that made NetBox refuse, and if
 * exactly one object answers, stamp our uid on it and use it. Only the custom
 * field is patched. Nothing about the customer's object is renamed, moved or
 * re-parented.
 *
 * The guards are the point, and they are the ones three reviewers wrote after
 * refuting the first version of this idea:
 *
 *   - Only specs that HAVE a natural key. A rack and a device deliberately do
 *     not. A device sitting at a shelf is somebody's asset, and claiming it
 *     because the position collided is exactly the mis-merge that was refuted:
 *     it stays a failure until the rack ladder and a person bind it.
 *   - The key must be complete and scoped. An interface is found by its device
 *     and its name, never by name alone; a VLAN by its id AND its site, never
 *     by an id that repeats across an estate.
 *   - Exactly one hit. Two is ambiguous and is left as a failure.
 *   - An object already carrying somebody else's uid is never taken. That is
 *     the "one uid on two objects" trap, and it stops here.

/**
 * Devices the record holds for this rack that this scan did not see.
 *
 * This is the plan's finding "a device on the record, gone from the rack", and
 * until now it could not fire on the devices that matter. The check used to
 * throw away every record that did not carry our own uid, so the customer's own
 * devices - the ones somebody typed in when the rack was built, which are most
 * of them - were invisible to it and the list came back empty however full the
 * rack was. Now a record in this rack that this scan did not see is reported
 * whether RackTrack wrote it or the customer did, and the row says which.
 *
 * Rule 3 is unchanged and is the reason this is safe to widen: these are
 * REPORTED. Nothing here deletes, patches, or even reads a device into the
 * write path. It is still scoped to this one rack, so a device in another rack
 * is invisible to it.
 *
 * Three records are not "gone from the rack": one this scan carries under its own
 * uid, one a person has bound this scan to (which matters on a preview, where the
 * bind has not been written yet, so the record still carries nothing of ours),
 * and one a box in this scan plainly answers for - by its serial, its asset tag
 * or the shelf it is on. That third case is the one that made the widened check
 * lie: with the rack bound and its boxes not, every box the scan was looking at
 * was reported as missing from the shelf it was visible on, beside a create for
 * the same shelf that a real NetBox refuses. Both statements were about the same
 * box and one of them was false.
 *
 * So a record a box answers for comes back as "on the record, not yet bound",
 * with the box that answers named, and "gone from the rack" keeps its meaning:
 * the record says this box is here and the scan found that shelf empty.
