/**
 * Give each port the NetBox record that already carries its number.
 *
 * A port's identity is the number printed beside it. The uid the camera side
 * gives a port is built from its place in the detection list, which is not
 * stable: a second reading lists ports in another order, some ports come and go
 * between readings, and earlier writes may have created records under uids no
 * current reading uses. So NetBox can hold "45" on a switch under one uid while
 * this reading calls port 45 by another, and the write then asks NetBox for a
 * second "45" on that switch, which it refuses. On the demo rack's 52 port
 * switch that was nine refusals after every other fix.
 *
 * This runs once, when a snapshot is built, against NetBox as it is:
 *
 *   1. A port whose number one of our records on that device already carries
 *      takes that record's uid. Nothing to rename, nothing to create.
 *   2. Any other port keeps its own uid if no port took it in step 1 - its
 *      record, if it has one, is renamed to a number nobody holds, so the
 *      rename cannot collide - or else gets a new uid that no record carries,
 *      so it never takes over a port this reading did not see.
 *
 * It is done here, where the snapshot is made, and stored with it, so the plan
 * a person approves, the items they approve or reject, and the write that
 * follows all name every port the same way. Only our own records are
 * considered (the racktrack_uid field), only on the device the port belongs
 * to, and nothing is written: this changes the snapshot, not NetBox.
