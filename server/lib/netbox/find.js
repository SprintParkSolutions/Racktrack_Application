/**
 * Find the customer's own record, not only our own.
 *
 * Until this file existed, the only way anything in this system found an object
 * in NetBox was client.findByUid, which filters on OUR custom field
 * racktrack_uid. Nothing looked a device up by its serial, its asset tag, its
 * name or its shelf. So a rack the customer filled in by hand was invisible:
 * every box in it was planned as a create, NetBox refused the ones that
 * collided, and the devices already in the record could not be reported either.
 *
 * This module answers one question and writes nothing: "which NetBox object is
 * this, if any". It is a resolver. It never patches, never creates, never
 * stamps a uid, and it has no side effects at all, so it can be called from a
 * preview as freely as from a write.
 *
 * The owner's sentence is "connect a rack to the database rack exactly the one,
 * I need 100 percent guarantee on that". The guarantee is not that this always
 * answers. It is that it NEVER names the wrong one. So:
 *
 *   1. Every lookup is SCOPED. A rack is looked up inside one site and never
 *      across the whole instance; a device by name inside one site, by position
 *      inside one rack. An unscoped lookup is refused with a sentence saying
 *      what would settle it, because "Rack 1" exists at every site there is.
 *   2. Every lookup asks for TWO rows and refuses when two answer, naming both.
 *      It never takes the first hit. A tie is never broken by sort order.
 *   3. Every hit is VERIFIED against the value that was asked for, in the same
 *      normalised form identity.js compares hardware values in, because NetBox's
 *      own text filters are looser than they look.
 *   4. An object already carrying a racktrack_uid that is not the one being
 *      asked about is NEVER returned. It belongs to another identity, and
 *      claiming it is the "one uid on two objects" trap.
 *   5. Every answer carries a plain English sentence a person reads.
 *
 * Three shapes come back, and only three:
 *
 *   { id, by, rank, evidence, confidence, row, why }   exactly one object
 *   { none: true, why }                                nothing answered
 *   { ambiguous: [ {id, name, ...}, ... ], why }       more than one answered
 *
 * `by` says which identifier did it: 'facility-id', 'serial', 'asset-tag',
 * 'rack-position' or 'name'. `rank` and `evidence` are minted through
 * identity.evidence so a rank this version cannot honestly produce cannot be
 * claimed here either. A record key that names the hardware - a facility id, a
 * serial, an asset tag - is 'modelled' (rank 3): the system of record states it.
 * A SHELF and a NAME are both 'inferred' (rank 8) with one candidate, which
 * reads as 'possible' and is never written. The plan's own confidence table
 * says so for the shelf ("only the shelf or the shape fits ... never written")
 * and standard 4.4 says so for the name: a name finds the record and proves
 * nothing about the hardware in it, and the box on a shelf today is not
 * necessarily the box that was on it yesterday.
 *
 * Nothing here binds anything. A bind is evidence plus a person, and the person
 * half arrives separately.
