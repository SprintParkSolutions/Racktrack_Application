/**
 * Bindings: which device a person said sits in which box, kept outside the scan.
 *
 * A binding is a dated, sourced statement that one device identity occupies one
 * box in one rack (standard section 2). It is a record in its own right, and the
 * reason it lives here rather than in the scan payload is a bug we had:
 * store.setPayload rewrites a scan's payload wholesale, so re-adopting a rack, or
 * re-running detection on it, silently dropped every match anybody had confirmed.
 * A person's answer must outlive the photograph they gave it about.
 *
 * So the file is keyed on the rack, not the scan: one file per scope, where a
 * scope is a tenant plus the scan's rack id - the one handle on a rack that
 * nothing recomputes. A second photo of the same rack lands in the same scope and
 * finds the same bindings by alias, without anybody confirming anything twice.
 *
 * Written in the same shape as unmanaged.js: plain JSON on disk, read and written
 * whole. There is no query load here - a rack holds a handful of boxes - and a
 * database would be one more thing to fail on a fresh machine. When that stops
 * being true, this module is the only thing that changes.
 *
 * What it will not do:
 *   - store a binding whose identity is only a name or a management address
 *     (standard 4.3, 4.4). Nothing weaker than a serial, chassis, bridge or
 *     management address gets to be an identity;
 *   - keep two bindings for one box, or two for one identity. A confirm replaces
 *     whatever it contradicts, and says so in the record it returns.
