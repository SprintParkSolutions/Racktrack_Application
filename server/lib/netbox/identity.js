/**
 * Who a device is, taken from what its own hardware published.
 *
 * The mistake this module exists to prevent: keying a device on ONE field. Our
 * own office proved why. The phone read a TP-Link and got a serial from the
 * maker's private tree; the server read the same switch over LLDP and got a
 * chassis address instead. Key on "the best field available" and one switch
 * becomes two devices, because the two readings never agree on which field is
 * best. Key on the SET of everything each reading published and they overlap,
 * so one switch stays one switch.
 *
 * So an identity here is a set of aliases, each written as "kind:value":
 *
 *   serial   a serial number, from the physical inventory or the maker's tree
 *   chassis  the chassis address the device publishes over LLDP
 *   bridge   the bridge base address it publishes as a switch
 *   mac      the hardware address of its management interface
 *   sysname  the name it calls itself - NOT an identity, standard 4.4
 *   host     the management address we reached it on - provisional, 4.3
 *
 * Two identities are the same device when they share a STRONG alias: serial,
 * chassis, bridge or mac. A shared name or a shared management address is never
 * enough, because both are configuration and both get reused.
 *
 * Pure: no files, no network, no clock. Everything here is a function of its
 * arguments, so it can be reasoned about and tested exhaustively.
 *
 * The rules are docs/design/rack-binding-standard.md. Section numbers are cited
 * where a rule comes straight from it.
