/**
 * Join the camera scan with what the switches said about themselves.
 *
 * The camera knows WHERE a device sits (its U position) but guesses at what it
 * is. A managed switch knows exactly what it is (model, serial, every port)
 * but has no idea where it sits. Neither can be matched to the other
 * automatically with certainty, because the one shared handle -- how many
 * ports -- is not unique when a rack holds two identical switches. So the
 * match is proposed here by port count and CONFIRMED by a human in Review.
 *
 * Once a switch is matched to a rack position AND somebody has confirmed that box
 * at the rack, this overwrites the camera's guesses with the switch's own facts
 * (Evidence.SNMP), keeps the U position the camera gave (the switch cannot know
 * it), and builds cables from LLDP where both switches are placed in confirmed
 * boxes. A match nobody confirmed is shown on the screen and in the report, and
 * put into no record: a port-count agreement is not a serial number, and writing
 * one into a customer's DCIM converts our uncertainty into their fact.
 *
 * Nothing is invented. A field the switch did not state stays exactly as the
 * camera left it, and a cable whose two ends cannot both be resolved is not
 * drawn.
