/**
 * Put a switch on the shelf the customer's own record already puts it on.
 *
 * Both halves of the answer exist and were never joined. The photograph knows
 * WHERE every box sits and guesses at what it is. A managed switch, asked over
 * SNMP, states exactly what it is - its serial, the address it answered on -
 * and knows nothing about where it sits. And in the middle sits the customer's
 * record, which holds both: NetBox says "this serial, this management address,
 * on U20 of this rack".
 *
 * So once the rack is identified (lib/rack_identity), the record for that rack
 * is the bridge:
 *
 *     switch answered at 10.10.1.21, serial FX2938401
 *         |  the record holds that serial on U20
 *         v
 *     U20  ->  the box the photograph drew at U20
 *
 * That is the owner's sentence on 23 September 2026: "when you found the
 * database rack of your physical rack you will know every unit position device
 * and correspondingly it will have ip, serial numbers and all, and you have the
 * same info in the logical layer network switches - using both, physical unit
 * rack to the network rack switch."
 *
 * The rule this module holds to is the one the rest of the identity code holds
 * to: never name the wrong one. So only two things place a switch, and both are
 * identities rather than resemblances -
 *
 *   serial   the switch's own serial equals the serial on the record
 *   address  the switch answered at the address the record calls its own
 *
 * A name agreement does not place anything. Two switches in one rack are
 * routinely called the same thing with a digit changed, and a name is a label
 * somebody typed; it is carried out as a note so a person can see it, and it
 * decides nothing.
 *
 * What comes back is rank 3 evidence, `modelled` - "the system of record says
 * so" - which is below a person confirming the box in front of them (rank 1)
 * and above every score built out of port counts and model strings (rank 8).
 * It proposes; the person at the rack still outranks it.
 *
 * Nothing here talks to NetBox or to a switch. It is given both sides and
 * joins them, so it can be tested without either.
