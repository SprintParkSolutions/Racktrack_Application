/**
 * Read a rack's photograph again with the models the server has now.
 *
 * A rack id is a hash of its photograph, and an analysed rack is a cache hit
 * for ever: scanning the same photo again returns the stored result. That is
 * right for speed and wrong the day a model improves. The patch panel model,
 * the trained unit grid and the OCR all reached new photographs and never an
 * old one, so a rack scanned before an improvement kept the older reading.
 *
 * The hard part is not running the pipeline, it is what else in the rack's
 * folder is keyed by the old reading. A better unit grid numbers the rack
 * differently, and the OCR result and a person's own correction are both filed
 * under a U ("U12": D-Link, "U12": DGS-1024C). Left as they are, the D-Link
 * override would be applied to whatever box the new grid happens to put at
 * U12. So each old box is matched to its new box by where it sits on the photo,
 * which is the one thing a re-read of the same photograph cannot change, and
 * everything keyed by U or by device number is carried across under the new
 * one.
 *
 * Nothing is deleted. The whole folder is copied aside first, and derived files
 * that rebuild themselves from the map (the stored result, the report, the
 * topology, the physical layer) are simply left to rebuild.
