/**
 * Which Site a scan is for.
 *
 * A technician belongs to one Site and every scan they run is that Site's. An
 * organisation admin and the owner belong to none, so their scans used to land
 * on the default tenant: claimed for nobody's Site, matched against nobody's
 * racks, and sent to no SPOC. The scan screen now names the Site, and that
 * choice replaces the caller's own tenant for the whole request - the claim,
 * the space check, the scan meta and the scope the rack id is minted under -
 * so an admin scanning at Site 32 gets the rack id a Site 32 technician would.
 *
 * Two things live here and nowhere else:
 *   listFor(user)                  the Sites the scan screen offers this person
 *   resolve(authPayload, siteId)   the Site one scan request is for, or a 404
 *
 * Who may name which Site is lib/estate.accessLevel, the rule organisation
 * setup already answers to; read is enough. A Site the caller may not read is
 * 404, never 403, as everywhere else: a 403 would confirm the Site exists.
 *
 * No coordinates and no address leave this file. The Site is chosen by a
 * person, not worked out from where the phone is.
