/**
 * Rack identity: which of the customer's racks is this scan?
 *
 * A scan is known only by a hash of its photo (the RK- id), and every new
 * photo of the same rack is a new hash. This module says which rack the
 * customer already has that scan is, shows the evidence, and refuses to choose
 * when it is not clear. It is the rack half of the ladder in
 * docs/netbox/match-and-reconcile.html, built for any datacentre: nothing here
 * knows a customer, a naming scheme or a site.
 *
 * It builds on lib/netbox/rack_match, the resolver the rest of the system
 * already uses (a row typed for the scan, the name a person gave the scan, the
 * rack looked up in NetBox, and the key NetBox ids are built on). What is added
 * here is what that resolver does not have: the label read from the photo, the
 * devices read from the photo, a stricter only-rack rule, the evidence, and a
 * person's confirmation.
 *
 * The ladder, in order. It stops at the first rung that leaves exactly one rack:
 *
 *   1. record        the scan already carries a rack: a person confirmed it
 *                    (rack_identity row), or its own racks_known row was typed
 *   2. label         a rack label read from the photo, or the name a person gave
 *                    the scan, equals exactly one known rack name or facility
 *                    id in this space
 *   3. label-netbox  the same label against the NetBox racks of this Site
 *   4. devices       most device names on the scan sit under one rack in NetBox
 *                    (at least 3 names read, 60 percent agreement, and no second
 *                    rack within 10 points)
 *   5. only-rack     the space is said to hold one rack, one rack is set up in
 *                    it, and no other scan in it is unaccounted for
 *
 * Two of them state a rack: decision 'matched', with the rackKey the rest of
 * the system builds NetBox ids on. They are 'record', and a 'label' that equals
 * one rack in the space the scan was tied to. The other three are inference, so
 * they only ever suggest: decision 'suggested', one candidate with its score
 * and reasons, rack null and rackKey null, until a person confirms. A room set
 * up with one rack and holding twelve would otherwise merge all twelve into it.
 *
 * A rung that finds more than one rack does not decide; its racks stay on the
 * list. A later rung that brings different evidence (devices, the space) may
 * then speak only by agreeing with one rack on that list. If it names a rack
 * that is not on the list, the two disagree and nobody is chosen.
 *
 * Otherwise: 'ambiguous' when two or more racks remain, 'new' when the space
 * still has racks nobody has scanned and nothing matched (the name proposed is
 * the label that was read, never one made up here), 'unknown' when there is
 * nothing to go on.
 *
 * NetBox is only ever asked with a site filter. When which NetBox site is this
 * Site cannot be told, what NetBox answers is listed as candidates and never
 * suggested, because "Rack 1" at another site is a different rack.
 *
 * The rule it holds to: never pick between ties, and never invent a value
 * nobody read. identify() reads only. confirm() is the one write, and it is a
 * person's decision: it ties the scan to a racks_known row and records that in
 * rack_identity with source 'confirmed'.
 *
 * Schema (added on the first confirm, additive and idempotent):
 *   rack_identity(tenant_id, rack_id, known_rack_id, netbox_rack_id, source,
 *                 confirmed_by, confirmed_at), one row per (tenant, scan).
 *   No foreign keys on purpose: removing an organisation deletes racks_known
 *   and tenants, and a reference from here would block it. A row whose rack is
 *   gone can never resolve, because racks_known ids are never reused.
 *
 * Same database and env override as lib/estate.js, for the same reason: tests
 * seed a throwaway file and point this module at it.
