// Memo for the vendor-lookup endpoints (/api/specs, /api/firmware). Both
// spawn Python and both can go to the live web, and neither answer changes
// minute to minute — a model's spec sheet is fixed, and a vendor's latest
// firmware moves maybe weekly. Yet every page load re-paid the full cost,
// because the client's cache is a module-level Map that a reload wipes.
//
// Measured on a fast laptop: a model the spec agent's DB knows answers in
// ~0.03s, but a garbled OCR model misses the DB and falls through to two live
// web lookups at ~7s each. Firmware ranged 0s to 5s, with a 90s ceiling and
// browser-driving providers for some vendors. On a 2-vCPU box all of that is
// worse. Caching it is the difference between a page that loads and a page
// you wait for.
//
// In-memory on purpose: re-warming after a restart is cheap, and it sidesteps
// invalidating a file on disk entirely. The contents are public facts about
// hardware — no tenant data — so one cache serves every caller.
