/**
 * Where a photo was taken, against where the organisation's Sites are.
 *
 * Indoors a phone knows its position to tens of metres at best, which is far
 * too coarse to tell one rack from the next and plenty to tell one datacentre
 * from another. So this answers one question and no other: was the photograph
 * taken at the Site the scan is filed under, at a different Site of the same
 * organisation, or nowhere near any of them?
 *
 * That matters because every other rung of the rack ladder looks for the rack
 * inside the scan's Site. A scan filed under Hyderabad DC1 but photographed in
 * Bengaluru DC1 can still read a label like "Rack 1" and match Hyderabad's
 * Rack 1, a different rack in a different city. The location is what can say
 * so.
 *
 * Pure: no database, no clock. The ladder passes the Sites in.
