// The point is that /api/analyze can be driven end to end — multipart upload,
// image normalisation, rack id, tenant claim, response shape — with no Python,
// no GPU and no model weights. Before the injection seam existed the pool was
// a boolean: you could switch the pipeline off, which made every AI route 500,
// but you could not replace it, so the product's primary workflow had no
// automated coverage at all.
//
// Responses are the minimum shape the server actually reads. Where a test
// needs a different answer it sets FAKE_POOL_MODE.

// checkout and pass on a re-run, because a cached rack skips the gate.
