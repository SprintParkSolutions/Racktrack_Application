/**
 * The pool's handling of a worker whose CUDA context has died.
 *
 * Production logged nine consecutive scans failing with the identical
 * "CUDA error: unknown error" and would have logged nine hundred: the worker
 * answered {ok:false} rather than crashing, so the pool — which recycled only
 * on exit and timeout — handed the same dead context to every request that
 * followed. These tests pin the three behaviours that fix it: a poisoned worker
 * is replaced and the request retried, a genuinely dead GPU stops the churn
 * instead of respawning forever, and an ordinary request failure still costs
 * the worker nothing.
