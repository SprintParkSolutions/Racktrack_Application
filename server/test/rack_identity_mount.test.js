/**
 * The rack identity router is mounted in app.js behind the real login gate.
 *
 * Same fact setup_mount.test.js checks for /api/setup, for the same reason:
 * the mount sits in a try/catch that logs and carries on, so a router that
 * failed to load would 404 while the server looked healthy. A 401 says the
 * router is there and the gate is in front of it. The physical layer route
 * shares its builder with this router since that builder was pulled out into
 * a function, so it is checked to still answer.
 *
 * Same harness as smoke.test.js: NODE_ENV=test, PORT=0, worker pool skipped.
