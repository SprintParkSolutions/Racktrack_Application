/**
 * Review: join the two witnesses and let a person confirm the join.
 *
 * The camera knows where each device sits. The switch knows what it is. The one
 * thing neither states is which is which, so the operator confirms the match
 * here: this switch is that box in the rack. Once confirmed, the switch's own
 * model, serial, real ports and LLDP cabling are merged onto the camera's
 * layout, and that merged result is what Export writes.
 *
 * Three rules this screen keeps to:
 *
 *   Confirming is a person's act. The Confirm button beside a switch is the
 *   only thing that confirms it. Saving the list keeps the choices and confirms
 *   nothing, so nothing downstream can read a proposal as a finding.
 *
 *   Every proposal shows its reasons in words. The server sends the evidence it
 *   used; this screen writes it as a sentence a person can check against the
 *   box, and says how sure it is in a word rather than a score.
 *
 *   Where two boxes look the same, nothing is preselected. The screen says what
 *   would tell them apart instead of picking one and hoping.
 *
 * A field the switch did not state is left as the camera had it. A cable whose
 * two ends cannot both be resolved is not drawn. Disagreements are surfaced,
 * never settled silently. Nothing is invented.
 *
 * Ported from RackTrack for NetBox. The route carries V1's rack id; the NetBox
 * side keeps its own numeric scan id, obtained (or created) once per visit
 * with POST /api/nb/scans/adopt/:rackId -> { id }.
