/* Nothing in this app cuts text short.
 *
 * The owner's rule, 23 September 2026, after the Report page came back with a
 * button reading "Drift ch...": never show dots in place of words, anywhere
 * in the app. A label that does not fit wraps onto a second line; a long
 * unbroken identifier wraps mid-word rather than running off the screen.
 *
 * This is the guard. It reads the source itself rather than rendering
 * anything, because truncation is written in three different places and only
 * one of them is visible in a component test:
 *
 *   text-overflow: ellipsis   in a stylesheet
 *   -webkit-line-clamp        which also ends a paragraph in dots
 *   'x'.slice(0, n) + '…'     in the JavaScript that builds a label
 *
 * If you are here because this failed: do not add the file to the allow-list.
 * Let the words wrap - `overflow-wrap: anywhere` is the replacement, and it
 * keeps a long id inside the screen without hiding any of it.
